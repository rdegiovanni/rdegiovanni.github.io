## Testing

[Î¼BERT](https://github.com/rdegiovanni/mBERT) is a mutation testing tool that uses CodeBERT, a pre-trained language model, to generate mutants (Mutation 2023). 

[Cerebro](https://github.com/garghub/Cerebro) is a machine learning approach that statically selects subsuming mutants, i.e., the set of mutants that resides on the top of the subsumption hierarchy, based on the mutants' surrounding code context (TSE 2021). 

[Trovon](https://github.com/garghub/TROVON) is a vulnerability prediction technique that learns from known vulnerable components rather than from vulnerable and non-vulnerable components, as typically performed (EMSE 2022). 

Dataset of [mutants relevant during code evolution](https://mutationtesting-user.github.io/evolve-mutation.github.io/) used in our exploratory study (TOSEM 2022).

## Requirements Analysis

[ACoRe](https://sites.google.com/view/acore-2022) is a tool that implements multi-objective search algorithms for resolving goal-conflicts in formal requirements specifications (FASE 2023). 

[BCLearner](http://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/rdegiovanni/ASE2018.html) implements a genetic algorithm for identifying goal conflicts (ASE 2018).

[BCTableaux](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/rdegiovanni/ase2016.html) implements a satisfiability tableaux-based algorithm for computing goal-conflicts (ASE 2016). 

This [tool](http://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/rdegiovanni/ICSE2018.html) can be used for assessing the likelihood and severity of goal-conflicts by using model counting (ICSE 2018).

[Here](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/rdegiovanni/case-studies/ICSE2014.zip) we provide the dataset and the experimental results of our automatic Goal Operationalisation approach (ICSE 2014).

[CLTSA](http://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/tools/cltsa) is a Labelled Transition System Analyser with Counting Fluents Support (ICSE 2015 and FSE 2017).

This [tool][https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/rdegiovanni/case-studies/SCR_Analysis.zip] implements an automatic abstraction process to analyse SCR requirements specifications. It can be use for verification or test generation (TAP 2011 and STVR 2018).
