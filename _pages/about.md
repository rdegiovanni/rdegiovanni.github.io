I’m a Research Scientist at the [SnT](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt), University of Luxembourg. 

My research interests lie mainly in the areas of software analysis and software engineering, with a focus on the interplay between formal methods, software testing and machine learning.

**==== Short Bio ====**<br/>

I got my PhD in Computer Science in 2015 at the *National University of Cordoba*, Argentina, under the supervision of Prof. [Nazareno Aguirre](http://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/naguirre/). 
My dissertation, entitled as *Automated Techniques for the Elaboration, Validation and Verification of Requirements Specifications*, presents two automated techniques to assess and improve the quality of software requirements specifications, by exploiting powerful formal analysis mechanisms, such as SAT Solving and model checking. 

From 2015 to 2017, I was a Teaching Assistant and a Postdoc at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Río Cuarto, Argentina. 

Since 2017, I am an *Assistant Professor* (currently on leave) at the Department of Mathematics at the National University of Río Cuarto, Argentina. 

Since 2019, I am an *Assistant Researcher* (currently on leave) at the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Argentina.

Since 2019, I joined the Security Design and Validation research group, SERVAL, at SnT University of Luxembourg. Since then, I have been a Postdoc and since 2022 a *Research Scientist*.
