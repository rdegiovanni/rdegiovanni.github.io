I’m a Senior Research Scientist at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST). 

My research interests lie mainly in the areas of software analysis and software engineering, with a focus on the interplay between formal methods, software testing and machine learning.

**==== Short Bio ====**<br/>

I got my PhD in Computer Science in 2015 at the *National University of Cordoba*, Argentina, under the supervision of Prof. [Nazareno Aguirre](http://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/naguirre/). 
My dissertation, entitled as *Automated Techniques for the Elaboration, Validation and Verification of Requirements Specifications*, presents two automated techniques to assess and improve the quality of software requirements specifications, by exploiting powerful formal analysis mechanisms, such as SAT Solving and model checking. 

From 2015 to 2017, I was a Teaching Assistant and a Postdoc at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Río Cuarto, Argentina. 

From 2017 to 2019, I was an *Assistant Professor* at the Department of Mathematics at the National University of Río Cuarto, Argentina. 

Since 2019, I am an *Assistant Researcher* (currently on leave) at the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Argentina.

In 2019, I joined the Security Design and Validation research group, SERVAL, at SnT University of Luxembourg. From 2019 to 2022 I was a Postdoc and from 2022 to 2024 a *Research Scientist*.

In 2024, I joined as a *Senior Research and Technology Scientist* to the Software Engineering RDI Unit research group, leaded by Prof. Jordi Cabot, at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).
