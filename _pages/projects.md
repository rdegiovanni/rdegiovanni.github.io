## MeMoRIA: “Metamorphic Relation Inference Automation”. Fonds National de la Researche Luxembourg - CORE.

This is an FNR CORE funding project. The project was written together with Mike Papadakis (PI). 

It is about Software Testing that forms one of the key quality assurance methods. Typically deciding, for a given software system, if its executions correspond to correct/desired software behaviours as opposed to defective/anomalous ones, is currently a largely manual task limiting testing applications. To this end, MeMoRIA will develop effective and efficient techniques for the automated test oracle generation, expressed as metamorphic properties. MeMoRIA will aim to assist engineers during the testing process, specially when metamorphic testing is applied, as well as, for the synthesis of runtime failure recovery methods, and for testing behavioural changes in evolving systems in CI environments.

Duration: 3 years: from 01-09-2023 to 30-08-2026.



## RASoRS: “Risk Analysis of Software Requirements Specification”. Fonds National de la Researche Luxembourg - CORE.
This is an FNR CORE funding. The project was written together with Mike Papadakis (PI) and we both significantly contribute to its implementation. The project is about developing techniques and tools for the identification, assessment and resolution of goal conflicts in requirements specification. In particular the project deals with requirements organised around specific goals and has the following objectives: (a) Automatic identification of goal conflicts in requirements specification (b) Defining assessment metrics for goal conflicts (c) Develop techniques and tools for resolving the goal conflicts All in all, the RASoRS project aims at providing ways for identifying, measuring and improving the quality of goal oriented software requirements. These are the most important ingredients for building reliable and robust software systems.

Duration: 3 years: from 01-07-2020 to 30-06-2023.
